ICH AC97 .wav player for DOS
----------------------------
Full Functional -complete- 16 bit (real mode) DOS Program (in 11/2023): 
(for playing .. 8bit, 16bit, 8-48kHZ, mono-stereo WAV files) 

***

playwav2.asm, PLAYWAV2.COM (included asm files: ich_wav.asm, ac97.asm, ac97.inc) ((plays WAV files via AC97 CODECs with VRA feature))

playwav3.asm, PLAYWAV3.COM (included asm files: ich_wav3.asm, ac97_vra.asm, ac97.inc) ((plays WAV files via VRA and non-VRA codecs))

playwav4.asm, PLAYWAV4.COM (included asm files: ich_wav4.asm, ac97_vra.asm, ac97.inc) ((plays WAV files via VRA and non-VRA codecs))

playwav5.asm, PLAYWAV4.COM (included asm files: ich_wav5.asm, ac97_vra.asm, ac97.inc) ((plays WAV files via VRA and non-VRA codecs))

***

(VRA: Variable Rate Audio, 8 to 48 kHZ audio playing ... non-VRA codec: Ony 48000 kHZ audio playing)

***

Recognized AC'97 Audio Controllers: ICH0 to ICH7, NFORCE, NFORCE2, NFORCE3, CK804 etc.  ((non-VRA codec example: ALC650 with CK804))

***

PLAYWAV2 music -wav file- play Method: tuneloop, double/2 (half) buffer switch/swap method, PCM OUT CIV-LVI and STatus reg handling.

PLAYWAV3 music -wav file- play Method: AC97 Interrupt (BCI), double/2 (half) buffer -switch/swap- method.

PLAYWAV4 music -wav file- play Method: tuneloop, software frequency conversion for non-VRA codecs (ALC650) ...

PLAYWAV5 music -wav file- play Method: AC97 Interrupt (LVBI), software frequency conversion for non-VRA codecs (ALC650) ...

The program displays active (in use) buffer as '1' or '2' (on the top left corner of the screen with red color) while playing music ('1' and '2' continuously changes) and waits for a keypress (int 16h, ah=01h) to stop/exit before the end of the WAV file (it will play all of the audio samples and then it will exit/return at the end of the WAV file if the user does not press any key before).

Playwav (2 to 5) is proper for playing 1-100 MB (very small to very big, huge) wav (music) files... (uses 2*64KB buffers for 16 bit samples and also uses a temporary 32KB buffer for converting 8 bit and mono samples to 16 bit stereo samples)

PLAYWAV2.COM, PLAYWAV3.COM, PLAYWAV4.COM and PLAYWAV5.COM can be tested with 256-512MB FAT16 (Retro DOS v4, MSDOS 5-6.22) or 1-2GB FAT32 (Retro DOS v5 or PCDOS 7.1) virtual disk or a physical harddisk -which will be recognized by MSDOS/RETRODOS- by copying WAV files into a directory. (MP3 files may be converted to WAV files for that). No need to HIMEM.SYS or DPMI or any audio device driver. Only requirement: AC97 ICH compatible audio hardware (also AC97 hardware may be emulated AC97 ICH instead of a real audio hardware).

Command: PLAYWAV2 FILE.WAV (PLAYWAV2 C:\WAV\FILENAME.WAV)
